-Background-
    Thirty Days-Hospital Readmission is an indicator of the quality of care in a hospital measured within 30 days after the patient is discharged from the hospital.
Chronic diseases are associated with being one of the factors a patient can return to the hospital, one of which is diabetes. Therefore, an accurate prediction is 
needed to determine whether a patient needs to be readmission based on the medical recap at his first visit. 
    Prediction of acceptance of hospital patient readmissions from the Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset for years 1999-2008 using the machine learning method type 
supervised learning, whereas will compare and choose one of the best between 9 (nine) models of the machine learning type supervised learning. 9 (nine) models to be 
used are k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification, Gradient Boosting Classification, Na√Øve Bayes Classification, Logistic 
Regression Classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and XGBoost. 
    The best prediction results obtained in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) sequentional API with performance 
reaching 25.040% in predicting the accepted readmission class and rejected readmission classes.
